# jquery-practice-april

wednesday - today 
set up jquery on my past websites and demo using some hide and show functions with an user-interactive webpage. This is just to troubleshoot and get more used to using my tool before i face similar obstacles while doing my project 

thursday - tomorrow 
set up jquery on a bootstrap template website with bootstrap, and practice using different Jquery events such as slidedown and slideup with bootstrap components. This is to demo any errors i might experience when including both on my website and prepare for any debugging ill have to do later on

friday - after tomorrow 
make a wireframe of a page including bootstrap grid, components, along with jquery. Then build that mini website and practice the process of building a website with my tool. Include some events like animate to troubleshoot any errors i might face (not familiar with animation). This is to help brainstorm what i want on my project and what combinations i want to use
